Experiment 1
============

Question: Are goals different for people with mindsets? (And can we pick up on that with this paradigm and in the domain of math?)

Goal Elicitation
----------------

Imagine that at West High School, there’s a class taught by Ms. S in which students are learning math.


Bob is taking a math test in this class. How much do you think he cares about each of the following things:

                                                   | cares a lot <-------> doesn't care at all
-------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------
getting a passing score on this test               | ------------------[]------------------
getting a high score on future tests               | ------------------[]------------------
being good at math                                 | ------------------[]------------------
improving at math                                  | ------------------[]------------------
showing his teacher that he has high math ability  | ------------------[]------------------
showing his teacher that he tries hard at math     | ------------------[]------------------

Mindsets Questionnaire (for binning)
------------------------------------

Maybe:

“Dweck Questionnaire” (View: Malleability/Change   Domain: Intelligence)

“You can learn new things, but you can't really change your basic intelligence” 5- point scale
